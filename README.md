# MinesweeperBot
This used to be the source of Minesweeper Bot, a Discord bot that would generate Minesweeper puzzles in chat.
Quite a while ago, however, I stopped hosting the bot and stopped working on it. This is the source for it.

Just before writing this, I tried running the bot again, but it's pretty broken. Feel free to use this code,
if you want to try and get it to work again.
